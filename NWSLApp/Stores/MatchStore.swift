//  MatchStore.swift
//  NWSLApp
//
//  The season's matches, fetched once and shared app-wide. Like FollowingStore,
//  this lives in Stores/ (not ViewModels/) and is injected via `.environment`
//  because more than one screen needs the same full-season event list: Schedule
//  renders all of it, a club's Team page renders its slice, and the future
//  your-teams-first Home will lead with followed clubs' next match. One fetch,
//  many readers — rather than each screen re-downloading ~240 events.
//
//  This is also the seam a future caching proxy/back end slots behind: today it
//  calls ESPN directly; later "one source of match data" can be served from a
//  server that polls ESPN once and fans out (see Reference/Sessions notes).

    // rename (relocation/rebrand) would silently empty a club's schedule. Real
