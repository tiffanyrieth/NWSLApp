# NWSLApp — Project Context for Claude

## Overview

**What:** A native iOS app for tracking the NWSL (National Women's Soccer
League) — live scores, full-season schedule, standings, team pages, and match
details.

**Why:** Personal project to build production-quality iOS skills and ship a
real consumer app. Long-term goal: App Store distribution.

**Scope:** A full-featured league app built incrementally over many releases —
schedule, standings, teams, player and match detail, and personalization over
time — not a single-screen demo. Architecture and conventions are chosen to
grow with it.

**Owner:** Tiffany Rieth

---

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Swift 5.9+
- **UI:** SwiftUI (not UIKit)
- **State:** `@Observable` (modern) over `ObservableObject` where possible
- **Networking:** `URLSession` + `async/await`. No third-party HTTP libraries
  unless justified.
- **Persistence:** TBD — start in-memory, add SwiftData if needed.
- **Testing:** Swift Testing (`@Test` + `#expect()`), not XCTest
- **Minimum iOS version:** iOS 17 (enables `@Observable`)
- **Xcode version:** 26.5

---

## Architecture

**Pattern:** MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel) with strict separation.

- `Models/` — `Codable` structs matching API responses; no UI or networking
- `Services/` — API clients (e.g. `ESPNService.swift`); no UI logic
- `ViewModels/` — `@Observable` classes that own view state; use the
  state-enum pattern (`idle` / `loading` / `loaded` / `error`)
- `Views/` — SwiftUI views, one screen per file; minimal logic
- `Components/` — reusable view pieces (cards, badges, etc.)

Folders are created when their first real file lands, not preemptively.

---

## Data Source

**Primary:** ESPN's unofficial NWSL endpoints (community reverse-engineered,
not officially supported).

- Base URL: `https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/soccer/usa.nwsl/`
- Scoreboard (full season):
  `scoreboard?dates=YYYY0101-YYYY1231&limit=500`
- Other endpoints to map as needed: standings, teams, news

**Known quirks (decode defensively):**
- Scores decode as `String` (`"0"`), not `Int`.
- Event timestamps sometimes arrive without seconds — custom date parsing is
  required (handled in `Event.kickoff`).
- The default scoreboard response caps at ~100 events; `&limit=500` returns the
  full season (~240 events for 2026).
- Standings lives at `apis/v2/…` NOT the `apis/site/v2/…` base (the site path
  returns `{}`).
- Player headshots are null for every NWSL athlete — squad cards show a
  jersey/initials monogram, not a photo (permanent, not a TODO).
- Feed articles are legal-limited to headline + summary + link — never the
  article body (reporter posts may carry full text).
- Endpoints are unsupported and undocumented — they can change shape, break, or
  rate-limit without notice. Fail gracefully.

**Future:** Possibly a Vercel serverless proxy in front of ESPN for caching,
response normalization, and a stable interface.

## Workflow & Engineering Practices

This project follows a deliberate, disciplined workflow. Treat the steps below
as requirements, not suggestions. If a request would bypass one — even in the
name of moving quickly — pause, flag it, and explain the trade-off before
proceeding.

**Before starting any session**
1. Run `git status` and report what's there. If there are uncommitted changes,
   resolve them (commit or stash) before starting new work.
2. Check the current branch. Never work on `main` — create a
   `feature/<short-description>` branch first. If the working branch is `main`,
   stop and branch before making changes.
3. State what we're about to do and which files you expect to touch.

**During work**
4. For any change touching 3+ files or introducing a new pattern, present a
   plan and get approval before editing.
5. Don't add a dependency (Swift Package, library) without first explaining why
   the built-in option won't work and getting approval.
6. No force-unwraps (`!`) in Swift unless a comment explains why it's safe.

**Before a feature is "done"**
7. The app builds and runs in the iOS Simulator with no errors.
8. The feature is manually verified in the simulator — confirmed working, not
   just compiling.
9. Commit messages are specific and present-tense, formatted
   `<Area>: <what changed>` (e.g. `Schedule: Add loading state while fetching
   matches`).
10. Update the **File Map** and **Current State** sections below to reflect
    what now exists.
11. Confirm before pushing to the remote. Don't auto-push.

**Never**
- Commit directly to `main`. Work on a feature branch and merge via PR.
- Skip simulator verification. "It compiles" is not "it works."
- Commit secrets, API keys, or tokens. Use a gitignored config or environment
  variable.

**Local enforcement:** the `hooks/` folder holds git hooks that back the
branch rule on this machine — `pre-commit` blocks commits onto `main`, and
`pre-push` blocks deleting/force-pushing `main` (warns on a direct push). They
are local guardrails, not policy: bypass with `--no-verify`, and a fresh clone
must run `git config core.hooksPath hooks` to enable them. (GitHub server-side
protection needs Pro on a private repo.) See `hooks/README.md`.

---

## Collaboration Preferences

This project doubles as a way to build durable iOS and software-engineering
skills, so understanding each change matters as much as shipping it. When
working in this repo:

- Explain the reasoning behind non-obvious decisions and trade-offs as you go,
  not just the resulting code.
- When introducing a new file or folder, note why it's organized that way.
- The first time a pattern appears (MVVM, state enums, `async`/`await`,
  `Codable`), briefly explain how it works.
- If a request reflects a misunderstanding or would introduce bad practice, say
  so and propose the better approach instead of silently complying.
- Favor idiomatic, maintainable Swift/SwiftUI over quick shortcuts.

---

## UI Requirements

- Persistent UI (tab bars, nav bars) must never obscure scrollable content —
  respect safe-area insets.
- Every drilled-in view has an explicit back affordance; don't rely on the
  edge-swipe gesture alone.
- Navigation state resets predictably (tapping a tab returns to its root).
- Placeholder tabs/sections are allowed only as intentional structural
  scaffolding — and only when they (a) show a clean "Coming soon" state (never a
  blank or broken screen), and (b) are flagged as placeholders in the File Map.
  The bar is: a placeholder must look deliberate, not forgotten.
- The schedule displays the full season, not a rolling window.
- Clarity over density — screens should breathe.

---

## Distribution

- Simulator + Personal Team sideload (free Apple tier). App Store deferred
  until the project reaches a presentable state.

---

## File Map (UPDATE THIS AFTER EVERY FEATURE)

Markers: ⚠️ = TEMP scaffolding (curated static seed; swap for a real backend —
the async signature is already shaped for it). 🔧 = intentional "coming soon"
placeholder (looks deliberate per the UI rules). Design specs in
`Reference/Design/*-spec.md` hold the full rationale.

## Current State

Root is `RootTabView` — a 5-tab bar (**Home · Schedule · Standings · Teams ·
Feed**), each tab its own `NavigationStack`; the app **lands on Home**. All five
tabs built. Following persists via `UserDefaults` (`FollowingStore`); SwiftData is
used **nowhere**. Each feature is built per its `Reference/Design/*-spec.md`
(approved in Cowork sessions) and **verified in-sim** via a temporary
launch-env/deep-link scaffold driving deterministic screenshots (UI taps flake
under memory pressure), then removed → gitignored `Reference/Design/*-verification/`.

**Home** (`home-tab-design-spec.md`) — your-teams-first hub; pre-onboarding renders
`OnboardingView` in place. Four modules — (1) "From your teams" content, (2) player
spotlights (one/followed team), (3) "Play" games, (4) "Coming up" fixtures — all
DERIVED by `HomeViewModel` from `MatchStore` + `FollowingStore`. Modules 1–2 on
⚠️seeds; no-follows re-presents the picker. Module 1's ⚠️seed is 2 real, recent
videos per club from each team's official YouTube — cards load the real frame
(`img.youtube.com/vi/{id}/…`, crest-tile fallback) and tap straight to the video.

**Play games** (`games-design-spec.md`) — all three built, each with its own color
+ ⚠️seed + session VM + durable `…Store`: **Daily Trivia** (indigo), **Bracket
Battle** (teal — deterministic seed-weighted "community" sim), **Predict the XI**
(pink — kickoff = offset-from-now so the demo always shows OPEN+SETTLED).

**Player Spotlight** (`spotlight-design-spec.md`) — one mini-profile/followed team
→ narrative `PlayerSpotlightView`; ⚠️`PlayerSpotlightProvider` seeds all 16
(Mondésir/SEA is the written-only fallback), rotated weekly. Each video is a real,
verified player-feature on YouTube, so the card and the detail hero load the real
frame (`img.youtube.com/vi/{id}/…`, crest-tile fallback).

**Feed** (`feed-tab-design-spec.md`) — reporters + news filtered to followed teams
(the conversation *around* your teams; distinct from Home Module 1). Chip bar
(All · per team · League) over ⚠️`FeedContentProvider`. The gear opens real
**Content Preferences** (`FeedSourcesView`): post/article toggles + per-source
mute, persisted in `FeedPreferencesStore`, filtering the live Feed.

**Teams + Following** — `TeamsView` lists all 16 (`/teams`); Follow stars write to
`FollowingStore` (followed float to a "Following" section). Onboarding also offers
followable **international competitions** (`FollowedCompetition` + a follow set) —
persisted, but the schedule isn't competition-aware yet (#13).

**Team detail** (`teams-tab-design-spec.md`) — pinned header + centered social row
(⚠️`TeamSocialLinksProvider`) over **Squad · Stats**. Squad = `PlayerCard` grid
(FWD→GK) → `PlayerDetailView` (bio + season block). Stats = real season summary
(roster W-D-L) + Goals/Assists/Clean-Sheets leaders. Per-player stats are
⚠️simulated (`StatsProvider`, deterministic/position-aware); leaders derive from
them so they match each player page. No formation pitch yet (needs lineup feed).
One `fetchRoster(clubID:)→ClubSquad` powers the page.

**Standings** (`standings-tab-design-spec.md`) — full 16-team table, **PTS · GP ·
W · L · D** only (no GF/GA/GD → avoids horizontal scroll); followed teams blue;
rows → `TeamDetailView`. Endpoint at `apis/v2/…` (not the app `base`).

**Schedule** (`schedule-tab-design-spec.md`) — full season in one
`fetchScoreboard(year:)` (~240 events for 2026); sticky day headers; three filters
(NWSL / My teams / All matches) over one `MatchStore`; cards carry 📍 venue · 📺
broadcast; scrolls to today, re-anchors on filter change.

---

## What's Next

Completed work is documented in **Current State**; only pending work is listed
here. Original item numbers are kept so existing cross-references stay valid.

**Near-term / cleanup**
1. **(Perf/TEMP)** `TeamLogo` uses bare `AsyncImage` — no cross-cell cache, crests
   re-download on scroll. Replace with a shared NSCache loader (or the proxy).
3. **(Polish)** Pull-to-refresh flips `state` to `.loading` (full-screen spinner);
   keep the list visible during refresh, spinner only on first load.
4. Capture a real ESPN response → `NWSLAppTests/Fixtures/scoreboard.json` + a
   decode-only test for `Scoreboard`/Event helpers (date parsing, `dayKey` TZ).
6. Make `MatchCard` tappable → a match detail screen (scorers/lineups/stats/news).
9. **(Fragility)** `MatchStore.matches(for:)` joins club↔game by `abbreviation`
   (ESPN competitors carry no id). TEMP-commented; a rename silently empties a
   schedule (empty state, not crash). Real fix: a normalized club-id map.
15. **(Cleanup)** Club directory is fetched independently by Teams/Home/Schedule
    VMs → a shared `@Observable ClubStore` (one fetch, many readers; ID→Club /
    ID→abbreviation lookup the My-teams filter and Home both need).
16. **(Robustness)** `ScheduleViewModel.loadClubs()` swallows a failed fetch
    (`(try? …) ?? []`) → My-teams shows an infinite spinner, no retry. Add an
    error state + retry (or fold into the ClubStore from #15).

**Feature follow-ups (from shipped redesigns)**
- **Team-detail Stats + PlayerDetailView** — built on ⚠️simulated stats
  (`StatsProvider`). Remaining: a real per-player stats source (ESPN's
  `athletes[].statistics.splits` is sparse — likely the proxy), and a
  most-recent-formation pitch (needs an unmapped lineup endpoint).
- **(Data/Verify) Team social links** — ⚠️`TeamSocialLinksProvider` curated seed;
  verify before ship. Reddit needs a browser check — **KC** (`r/KCCurrent`, low
  confidence), **CHI** (`r/redstars` vs post-rebrand `r/ChicagoStars`); **BOS/DEN/
  LOU** have no subreddit yet (no Reddit icon). YT/IG channel URLs overlap the
  teams `TeamContentProvider` points at — collapse when the real backend lands.
- **Follow-confirmation sheet** — first-time "what following buys you" on the
  header star. No Settings screen exists yet (adjusting follows post-onboarding).
- **Home Module 1** — thumbnails + deep links are now real (⚠️`TeamContentProvider`
  is a curated seed of real YouTube videos; cards load real frames + tap to the
  video). Remaining: build the "See all" destination, and swap the static seed for
  a live team-channel source that refreshes (these specific videos won't rotate or
  re-fetch on their own — a deleted video falls back to the crest tile).
- **Home Module 2 spotlight pipeline** — UI done; thumbnails are now real (each
  YouTube video id drives the card/hero frame). Remaining: a deeper per-team pool
  (weekly rotation cycles a full roster), the opt-in weekly notification, and a
  team-colored badge (needs club hex).
- **Home Module 3 games** — all built; remaining is swapping each off its ⚠️seed +
  social/push layers (real multi-user leaderboards via #12, share-result card,
  kickoff/streak push). Trivia: real question backend. Bracket: real voting backend
  (real "community", not the sim) + rotating editions. Predict: real fixtures +
  lineup feed (live, not the offset clock) + per-category stats + more questions.

**Longer-term (vision — see `Reference/Sessions/` for full rationale)**
11. **Feed backend** — UI on the ⚠️seed. Needs: a real content source (Bluesky/news
    aggregator or proxy); the editorial "no culture-war/political hot takes" gate as
    a real filter (`nwslapp-feed-content-rules.md`); user-added sources (Content
    Preferences already does type toggles + muting; adding accounts needs the
    backend); per-post **team tagging via a Claude Haiku call** that also drops
    non-NWSL content.
12. **Push notifications + the server question.** Scheduled reminders need NO server
    (kickoff times known → local notifications, free on sideload); **live updates
    need a server + APNs + the $99 Program**. The server doubles as the caching
    proxy. Full reasoning: `Reference/Sessions/2026-06-04_server-pulls-and-push.md`.
13. **Competition-aware schedule.** Groundwork: the three Schedule filters,
    `MatchCard`'s dormant `CompetitionBadge`, and a `FollowedCompetition` model +
    follow set wired to onboarding. Remaining: a competition on `Event` (so a
    followed competition actually filters the schedule + badges populate), plus a
    surface to change competition follows after onboarding (no Settings yet).
14. **Engagement / Home hub** — player spotlights (→ contributor pipeline),
    community links (subreddits/Discords), prediction games. Live as Home modules
    first, graduate to a tab only if earned. (Reuse the push/#12 backend.)
