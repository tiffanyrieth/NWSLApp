# NWSLApp — Project Context for Claude

## ⚠️ PRIORITY FRAMEWORK — READ FIRST

This app's differentiator is NOT stats, scores, or schedules. Every sports app has those.
This app exists because it feels ALIVE — fresh content every time you open it, fan engagement
that brings people together, and a personal connection to your teams and players.

PRIORITY ORDER (non-negotiable):
1. ALIVE FEATURES — Live content pipelines (YouTube → Home, Bluesky/Reddit → Feed, Spotlight rotation, Fan Zone rounds)
2. CORE FUNCTIONALITY — Scores, schedule, standings, stats (table stakes, must work, but not the differentiator)
3. HARDENING — Bug fixes, decode tests, abbreviation fragility, pull-to-refresh polish

Never prioritize category 3 over category 1. If someone asks "what's next?", the answer
is always the highest incomplete item in category 1 unless it's physically blocked.

The litmus test: "Would I open this app today if I opened it yesterday?"
If the answer is no because the content hasn't changed, that's the #1 priority to fix.

## Overview

**What:** A native iOS app for the NWSL (National Women's Soccer League) — live
scores, full-season schedule, standings, team pages, and match details.

**This is a HYBRID sports + fandom app — not purely either.** Frame every feature this
way. The "sports app" half (scores/schedule/standings/stats) is table stakes; the
**fandom** half — community engagement, the Fan Zone games (Bracket Battle's community
voting + creative editions, Predict the XI), social sharing, the live/"alive" content,
and personal connection to your teams — is **equally core to the identity.** Defaulting to
"it's a sports app" → ESPN-clone patterns is the failure mode to avoid; the differentiator
is the fandom side (see the Priority Framework).

**Why:** Personal project to build production-quality iOS skills and ship a
real consumer app. Long-term goal: App Store distribution.

**Scope:** A full-featured league app built incrementally over many releases —
schedule, standings, teams, player and match detail, and personalization over
time — not a single-screen demo. Architecture and conventions are chosen to
grow with it.

**Owner:** Tiffany Rieth

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Swift 5.9+
- **UI:** SwiftUI (not UIKit)
- **State:** `@Observable` (modern) over `ObservableObject` where possible
- **Networking:** `URLSession` + `async/await`. No third-party HTTP libraries
  unless justified.
- **Persistence:** UserDefaults for small local state (follows, game stats);
  Supabase (Postgres) as the durable per-user source of truth once signed in.
  SwiftData still used nowhere.
- **Auth / per-user backend:** Sign in with Apple → **Supabase**
  (Postgres + native Apple auth + Row-Level Security). The project's **first and
  only third-party dependency** is the **Supabase Swift SDK** (`supabase-swift`,
  SPM) — justified because rolling raw URLSession calls would mean reimplementing
  JWT refresh, RLS header injection, and session keychain storage. Credentials
  live in a **gitignored `Config/Secrets.swift`** (template: `Secrets.example`);
  the anon key is a public client key — RLS is the real boundary.
- **Testing:** Swift Testing (`@Test` + `#expect()`), not XCTest
- **Minimum iOS version:** iOS 17 (enables `@Observable`)
- **Xcode version:** 26.5

## Commands

```bash
# Build (Debug) for a booted simulator
xcodebuild build -scheme NWSLApp \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=<BOOTED_SIM_ID>' -configuration Debug

# Run the unit tests
xcodebuild test -scheme NWSLApp \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=<BOOTED_SIM_ID>' -only-testing:NWSLAppTests

xcrun simctl list devices booted                 # find the booted sim id
xcrun simctl install <SIM_ID> <NWSLApp.app>      # install a built .app
xcrun simctl launch  <SIM_ID> com.tiffanyrieth.nwslapp.NWSLApp
```

DEBUG launch args: `-resetOnboarding`, `-useESPNDirect`, `-useSeedContent`,
`-startTab <home|schedule|standings|teams|feed>`. Decode-only tests read
`NWSLAppTests/Fixtures/*.json` off disk via `#filePath` (no bundle membership).
**Driving the sim:** synthetic taps (cliclick) are unreliable for SwiftUI
controls — the UIKit tab bar responds but NavigationLinks/Buttons/Pickers often
don't, so in-sim verification uses temporary DEBUG deep-link/launch-arg scaffolds
(then removed). `idb ui tap` (HID-level) is the more robust route if installed.

---

## Architecture

**Pattern:** MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel) with strict separation.

- `Models/` — `Codable` structs matching API responses; no UI or networking
- `Services/` — API clients (e.g. `ESPNService.swift`); no UI logic
- `ViewModels/` — `@Observable` classes that own view state; use the
  state-enum pattern (`idle` / `loading` / `loaded` / `error`)
- `Views/` — SwiftUI views, one screen per file; minimal logic
- `Components/` — reusable view pieces (cards, badges, etc.)

Folders are created when their first real file lands, not preemptively.

---

## Data Source

**Primary:** ESPN's unofficial NWSL endpoints (community reverse-engineered,
not officially supported).

- Base URL: `https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/soccer/usa.nwsl/`
- Scoreboard (full season):
  `scoreboard?dates=YYYY0101-YYYY1231&limit=500`
- Other endpoints to map as needed: standings, teams, news

**Known quirks (decode defensively):**
- Scores decode as `String` (`"0"`), not `Int`.
- Event timestamps sometimes arrive without seconds — custom date parsing is
  required (handled in `Event.kickoff`).
- The default scoreboard response caps at ~100 events; `&limit=500` returns the
  full season (~240 events for 2026).
- Standings lives at `apis/v2/…` NOT the `apis/site/v2/…` base (the site path
  returns `{}`).
- Player headshots are null for every NWSL athlete — squad cards show a
  jersey/initials monogram, not a photo (permanent, not a TODO).
- Feed articles are legal-limited to headline + summary + link — never the
  article body (reporter posts may carry full text).
- Endpoints are unsupported and undocumented — they can change shape, break, or
  rate-limit without notice. Fail gracefully.

**Proxy (V2, 0.2.0):** A tiny Cloudflare Worker — `nwslapp-proxy` (sibling repo
`~/Projects/nwslapp-proxy`, GitHub `tiffanyrieth/nwslapp-proxy`, live at
`https://nwslapp-proxy.tiffany-rieth.workers.dev`). **Pass-through caching routes**
(`proxyAndCache`, Workers Cache API, match-state-aware TTL): `GET /scoreboard` and
`GET /summary?event={id}` (0.3.1) forward to ESPN and return bytes **unchanged** (app
decoders untouched); summary TTL via `chooseSummaryTTL` (finished→1yr, live→30s,
future→daily 7am UTC). **Content routes** (build + normalize to JSON): `/team-videos`,
`/feed`, `/spotlight` (B2). Teams/roster/standings still hit ESPN directly. Base URLs
in `Config/AppConfig.swift`; DEBUG `-useESPNDirect` falls back to ESPN. See
`Reference/Sessions/2026-06-08_v2-kickoff-caching-proxy.md`.

**Per-user backend (V2, 0.2.x):** **Supabase** is the stateful/per-user layer
(boundary: Workers = stateless/global; Supabase = stateful/per-user). **Sign in
with Apple** creates a Supabase user; a `profiles` row and a `follows` row-set
(team IDs, Row-Level-Security'd to the owner) persist per account. The app stays
**offline-first**: UserDefaults is the immediate local cache and the app never
blocks on the network to show follows; Supabase is the durable truth. On sign-in
the local and server follow sets are **merged (union — never delete)**, written
back down locally (covers new-device restore) and pushed up; afterwards each
follow/unfollow mirrors to Supabase best-effort. Only **clubs** sync (not
competitions yet). The Supabase client is built from the gitignored `Secrets`
(see `Config/AppConfig.swift` sibling `Services/SupabaseManager.swift`). The
Postgres schema (tables + RLS + the required `authenticated` grants) is checked
in at `supabase/schema.sql` — RLS alone isn't enough; a missing table grant fails
queries with `42501`. See `Reference/Sessions/2026-06-09_supabase-accounts-setup.md`.

**Future:** Expand the proxy to more endpoints + response normalization as
needed; leaderboard tables, competition-follow sync, and Tier-2 push build on
this account system.

## Workflow & Engineering Practices

This project follows a deliberate, disciplined workflow. Treat the steps below
as requirements, not suggestions. If a request would bypass one — even in the
name of moving quickly — pause, flag it, and explain the trade-off before
proceeding.

**Before starting any session**
1. Run `git status` and report what's there. If there are uncommitted changes,
   resolve them (commit or stash) before starting new work.
2. Check the current branch. Never work on `main` — create a
   `feature/<short-description>` branch first. If the working branch is `main`,
   stop and branch before making changes.
3. State what we're about to do and which files you expect to touch.

**During work**
4. For any change touching 3+ files or introducing a new pattern, present a
   plan and get approval before editing.
5. Don't add a dependency (Swift Package, library) without first explaining why
   the built-in option won't work and getting approval.
6. No force-unwraps (`!`) in Swift unless a comment explains why it's safe.

**Before a feature is "done"**
7. The app builds and runs in the iOS Simulator with no errors.
8. The feature is manually verified in the simulator — confirmed working, not
   just compiling.
9. Commit messages are specific and present-tense, formatted
   `<Area>: <what changed>` (e.g. `Schedule: Add loading state while fetching
   matches`).
10. Update the **File Map** and **Current State** sections below to reflect
    what now exists.
11. Confirm before pushing to the remote. Don't auto-push.

**Never**
- Commit directly to `main`. Work on a feature branch and merge via PR.
- Skip simulator verification. "It compiles" is not "it works."
- Commit secrets, API keys, or tokens. Use a gitignored config or environment
  variable.

**Local enforcement:** the `hooks/` folder holds git hooks that back the
branch rule on this machine — `pre-commit` blocks commits onto `main`, and
`pre-push` blocks deleting/force-pushing `main` (warns on a direct push). They
are local guardrails, not policy: bypass with `--no-verify`, and a fresh clone
must run `git config core.hooksPath hooks` to enable them. (GitHub server-side
protection needs Pro on a private repo.) See `hooks/README.md`.

**Known gotcha — `gh` auth expires mid-session.** The `gh` keyring token can go
stale partway through a session: `git push` keeps working (separate credential
helper) and `gh auth status` still reports "Logged in", but every `gh` API call
(`gh pr create`/`merge`/`view`, `gh api`) fails with `HTTP 401: Requires
authentication`. Fix: re-run `gh auth refresh -h github.com` (interactive —
the user runs it), then retry. So when a push succeeds but the follow-up PR
merge 401s, it's this, not a permissions problem.

---

## Collaboration Preferences

This project doubles as a way to build durable iOS and software-engineering
skills, so understanding each change matters as much as shipping it. When
working in this repo:

- Explain the reasoning behind non-obvious decisions and trade-offs as you go,
  not just the resulting code.
- When introducing a new file or folder, note why it's organized that way.
- The first time a pattern appears (MVVM, state enums, `async`/`await`,
  `Codable`), briefly explain how it works.
- If a request reflects a misunderstanding or would introduce bad practice, say
  so and propose the better approach instead of silently complying.
- Favor idiomatic, maintainable Swift/SwiftUI over quick shortcuts.

---

## UI Requirements

- Persistent UI (tab bars, nav bars) must never obscure scrollable content —
  respect safe-area insets.
- Every drilled-in view has an explicit back affordance; don't rely on the
  edge-swipe gesture alone.
- Navigation state resets predictably (tapping a tab returns to its root).
- Placeholder tabs/sections are allowed only as intentional structural
  scaffolding — and only when they (a) show a clean "Coming soon" state (never a
  blank or broken screen), and (b) are flagged as placeholders in the File Map.
  The bar is: a placeholder must look deliberate, not forgotten.
- The schedule displays the full season, not a rolling window.
- Clarity over density — screens should breathe.

---

## Navigation Identity

Each tab has a distinct job. When adding or redesigning a feature, check that
the *lens* matches the section and that adjacent sections stay consistent.
Full rationale in `Reference/navigation-architecture.md`.

- **Home** — your teams, right now. Personal + temporal. The engagement hub.
- **Schedule** — when do they play, what happened? Full-season calendar.
- **Standings** — where does your team sit? League position + competitive context.
- **Teams** — the club directory + deep dives. Season-level, relational.
- **Feed** — the conversation around your teams. Reporter/journalist voices.

**Adjacency rule:** when you change a section, check its neighbors. Schedule
cards and MatchDetailView share visual language. Team Page and MatchDetailView
share player data through different lenses (season vs. match). Home Module 1
(team content) and Feed (reporter content) are distinct voices — don't blur them.

---

## Distribution

- Simulator + Personal Team sideload (free Apple tier). App Store deferred
  until the project reaches a presentable state.

---

## Versioning

Two separate numbering systems — don't conflate them.

- **Phase names ("V1", "V2")** are internal chapters, not release numbers. V1 =
  the vision prototype (seed data, no backend). V2 = the real-backend era
  (proxy, accounts, live Feed). Use them in planning/notes only.
- **Release numbers** follow semver (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) and the project is
  **pre-1.0**: `0.x` means "not yet publicly released / still stabilizing."
  - **A minor bump = a whole new CHAPTER of the app, not a single feature.**
    0.1 set the grain: the *entire* prototype — all ~22 PRs, whole new tabs and
    games included — is **0.1.x**, one minor. So the *entire* backend era (proxy
    + accounts + Feed + push + player photos + every fix and surprise along the
    way) is likewise **one chapter → 0.2.x**, however many PRs it takes.
  - **Patch (third digit) = each shipped update inside the chapter.** Pre-1.0
    this includes new features, not just bug fixes (strict "patch = bugfix only"
    is a post-1.0 rule). The proxy (**0.2.0**), accounts, Feed, etc. are patch
    steps climbing under 0.2.x — they do NOT each earn their own minor. *Worked
    example:* proxy **0.2.0** → accounts ≈ **0.2.3** → live Feed ≈ **0.2.9** →
    game backends ≈ **0.2.15**, all still inside 0.2.x.
  - **A chapter's theme is a center of gravity, not a fence.** 0.2.x is *about*
    the backend, but pre-1.0 it also absorbs the bug fixes and small unrelated
    improvements that get shipped alongside — they ride the same 0.2.x patch
    line rather than spawning their own minor. Only a genuinely new *era* (a
    whole new tab, a major redesign, a distinct pre-launch beta) earns the next
    minor. Routine fixes and polish do not.
  - **Reserve 1.0.0 for the first public App Store launch.** Because a chapter
    is one minor, you arrive at 1.0 from somewhere low (≈0.2–0.3) and never
    balloon past it.
  - **Current line (owner's call):** **0.3.x = the BACKBONE chapter** (demo →
    live). **0.3.8** = the feed/content work (B1 News · B2 Spotlight · B3a chips ·
    B3b Instagram). **0.3.9** = the rest of the backbone (Fan Zone games + B4
    sweep). **0.4.x = QOL** — improving the *experience* of what's already alive,
    not backbone infrastructure.
- **Xcode has two fields, both required:** "Marketing Version"
  (`CFBundleShortVersionString`, the human-facing `0.2.0`) and "Build"
  (`CFBundleVersion`, a monotonic integer bumped on *every* TestFlight upload —
  TestFlight rejects a duplicate build number even when the marketing version
  is unchanged).
- **Tag releases in git** at each milestone (`git tag v0.2.0`) so repo history
  tracks the version line alongside the per-PR commits.

---

## File Map (UPDATE THIS AFTER EVERY FEATURE)

Markers: ⚠️ = TEMP scaffolding (curated static seed; swap for a real backend —
the async signature is already shaped for it). 🔧 = intentional "coming soon"
placeholder (looks deliberate per the UI rules). Design specs in
`Reference/Design/*-spec.md` hold the full rationale.

## Current State

Root is `RootTabView` — a 5-tab bar (**Home · Schedule · Standings · Teams ·
Feed**), each its own `NavigationStack`; **lands on Home**. **Dark appearance
app-wide**; no toggle. Following persists via `UserDefaults` (`FollowingStore`);
SwiftData used **nowhere**. The season (`MatchStore`) + club directory (`ClubStore`)
are each fetched **once and shared app-wide** via `.environment`; the My-teams schedule
filter surfaces a real error + retry if the directory fails. Features are built per
`Reference/Design/*-spec.md` and **verified in-sim** via a temporary screenshot scaffold
(see Commands), then removed.

**Design-system redesign (0.3.x — its own chapter, all 6 phases shipped)** — fidelity pass
vs the Claude Design handoff (`Reference/nwslapp-design-system/`). The `DesignSystem/` token
layer (dark-only hex; page `#1C1C1E`, cards `#2C2C2E`) backs every screen. **Crest rule:**
bare via `TeamLogo`, no ring (only player monograms get one). **Team colors:**
`DesignTeamColors` by abbreviation, so ESPN near-black primaries stay legible. **Nav:**
pushed screens show a left "‹ Label" via `.navigationContextLabel(…)`.

**Accounts & follow sync** (`…/2026-06-09_supabase-accounts-setup.md`) — Sign in with Apple →
a **Supabase** user (`AuthStore` upserts `profiles`; `RootTabView` restores the session +
starts `FollowSyncCoordinator`). **Optional/offline-first**: skippable post-onboarding
`SignInPromptView`; skipping leaves the app fully working on the UserDefaults cache. Sync
mechanics (union-merge, RLS, clubs-only) → Architecture / Per-user backend.

**Notifications — Tier 1 / LOCAL** (0.3.2; `local-notifications-spec.md`) —
`NotificationScheduler` (held alive by `RootTabView`) delivers two phone-scheduled alerts:
**day-before match reminder** (−24h) + **weekly Player Spotlight** (Mon 10am); permission on
first toggle-on. **Tier 2 / SERVER push** → What's-Next #12.

Per-screen behavior (full file detail in the File Map; specs in `Reference/Design/*-spec.md`):

- **Home** (`home-tab-design-spec.md`) — your-teams hub; pre-onboarding renders
  `OnboardingView` in place. Four `HomeViewModel` modules: (1) "From your teams" (Content
  Cards, LIVE), (2) spotlights (LIVE), (3) "Fan Zone" games, (4) "Coming up". Games ordered
  Predict → Bracket → Trivia (**Predict only when ≥1 club followed**); no-follows re-presents
  the picker.
- **Fan Zone games** (`games-design-spec.md`) — **Predict the XI** (pink) **LIVE** (0.3.9):
  pick a followed team's XI + formation + scoreline pre-match, auto-scored Mastermind-style
  vs ESPN `/summary` (max 88; Draft→Submit one-way, closes kickoff−2h, only submitted score).
  **Visibility rule (all games):** hidden EVERYWHERE (Home card + screen) when nothing
  active/upcoming — Predict's gate = followed-team fixture **within 28 days**; the module
  hides when no game is visible. **Bracket Battle** (teal) — ⚠️ **IN PROGRESS, NOT shipped**
  (0.3.9): the real 64-player / 6-round community-voting tournament. **App-side + real Supabase
  voting are DONE + verified** (5 screens per the Claude Design ref; tiered scoring
  1·1·2·2·3·3 (max 81, v2); no emoji in the game screens; draft→submit one-way; sign-in at
  submit; gate hides when no active
  edition; votes land in `bracket_votes`). **But the feature is NOT shipped** until the **proxy
  Worker engine is built — REQUIRED 0.3.9 work, not deferred** (auto-generate 64-player ESPN
  editions · auto-advance rounds · auto-tally votes at close · auto-rotate editions · Haiku
  creative themes). What's live now = one hand-seeded 16-player TEST edition + manual
  advancement = a scaffold. See What's Next. **Daily Trivia** (indigo) still ⚠️seed.
- **Player Spotlight** (`spotlight-design-spec.md`) — one mini-profile/followed team →
  `PlayerSpotlightView`. **LIVE** (B2/0.3.8) via proxy `/spotlight`: real player + ESPN stats
  + a Haiku "why watch" blurb, weekly rotation. Seed = offline-first fallback.
- **Feed** (`feed-tab-design-spec.md`) — reporters + news + social filtered to followed
  teams + league (distinct from Home Module 1). **Content-type** chip bar (All/News/Social —
  Social = every individual voice; B3a/0.3.8 folded "Reporters" in) over the LIVE `/feed`
  cards; gear → `FeedSourcesView` (type toggles + per-source mute).
- **Content Cards** (`we-are-going-to-iridescent-otter.md`) — one `ContentCard` model +
  `ContentCardView` router back BOTH Home Module 1 and the Feed via 7 layouts. Placement
  gate (Home = team voices; Feed = wider; `.both` either) + staleness (Home 72h / Feed 7d,
  6-card-floored, 0.3.7). **All LIVE** via `ContentService` → proxy (seed = fallback).
  **Home** ← `/team-videos` = YouTube + club OG news + club IG. **Feed** ← `/feed` = Bluesky
  map (reporters + league + 13/16 clubs; club Bluesky is `.feed`) + News + player IG.
  Server-side: Haiku relevance filter (`claude-haiku-4-5`, KV-cached), 3/account flood cap,
  `dedupeByContent`. B-item detail (B1 News RSS→Haiku-gate→OG-enrich · B2 `/spotlight` · B3a
  chips · B3b Apify IG cron→KV, TikTok deferred) → File Map + `Reference/Feed update/…handoff`.
- **Teams + Following** — `TeamsView` lists all 16 (followed float up); onboarding + a bottom
  row offer **international competitions** (persisted; schedule not competition-aware yet, #13).
- **Team detail** (`teams-tab-design-spec.md`) — pinned header + social row
  (⚠️`TeamSocialLinksProvider`) over **Squad · Stats**. Squad = `PlayerCard` grid (FWD→GK) →
  `PlayerDetailView`. Stats = season summary + Goals/Assists/Clean-Sheets leaders from **real
  ESPN stats** (`ESPNService.seasonStats`, actor-cached) (#8).
- **Standings** (`standings-tab-design-spec.md`) — full 16-team table (**PTS·GP·W·L·D**);
  followed rows tinted → `TeamDetailView`.
- **Schedule** (`schedule-tab-design-spec.md`) — full season in one `fetchScoreboard(year:)`;
  sticky day headers; 3 `MatchStore` filters; cards carry 📍 venue · 📺 broadcast; scrolls
  to today.
- **Match detail V2** (`match-detail-v2-spec.md`, `-polish.md`) — `MatchDetailView` + VM
  adapt to temporal state (Past/Live/Future); header from the `Event`, `/summary` (proxy)
  layers the rest (failure → header-only); `resolveMatchColors` keeps sides distinct.

## What's Next

Completed work lives in **Current State**; only pending work here. Item numbers are kept so
cross-references stay valid. **Ordered by the PRIORITY FRAMEWORK** — Category 1 (ALIVE)
always outranks 2/3.

**Category 1 — ALIVE features (TOP PRIORITY).** Do these before any Category 2/3 work and
before any TestFlight ship. The content pipeline is LIVE end-to-end (Home + Feed; YouTube ·
club OG news · Bluesky · News RSS · Instagram · Player Spotlight). **Backbone sequence**
(`Reference/BACKBONE.md` + `Reference/Feed update/` handoff): A1/A2 · B1 · B2 · B3a · **B3b
all SHIPPED**.
- **Fan Zone games (0.3.9):** swap the ⚠️seed games for live rounds, in order —
  ~~**Predict the XI** (LIVE)~~ ✅ → **Bracket Battle** ⚠️ **IN PROGRESS (NOT shipped).**
  App-side + real Supabase voting are DONE on `main` (PR #49: 5 screens, models, scoring,
  store/VM, Home gate; `BracketService` reads editions/matchups + upserts owner-scoped votes +
  reads `bracket_scores`; schema + one seed edition applied; vote round-trip verified). **The
  feature is NOT done until the proxy Worker engine is built — REQUIRED 0.3.9 backbone, NOT
  deferred. No partial credit; the box stays unchecked until ALL sub-items ship.** The Worker
  (`~/Projects/nwslapp-proxy`, service-role → Supabase) must: (1) **auto-generate real
  64-player editions** from ESPN roster+season-stats (stats-seeded templates) → write
  editions/entrants/matchups; (2) **advance rounds automatically** on the 2–3 day schedule
  (cron); (3) **tally votes automatically at round close** — community majority → winner +
  split, build next round, advance `current_round`, write `bracket_scores`; (4) **auto-generate
  the next edition after a break** (rotation); (5) **creative themes** (Haiku or pre-generated
  pool) mixed into rotation (all-rostered-players personality themes). No hand-seeded SQL, no
  manual advancement — must work as if public testing starts tomorrow. (Also: app-side full
  5-screen visual pass via a DEBUG nav scaffold.) → THEN **Daily Trivia** (question pool) →
  **Game Center** (GameKit leaderboards across all three). Then **B4 final sweep** → ship
  **0.3.9** (QOL begins at 0.4.0).
- **A3 Reddit → Feed** — DEFERRED (noisy; subreddits live in Teams). IG now via Apify (B3b).

**Category 3 — HARDENING** (cleanup/robustness — do AFTER Category 1, never above it)
3. **(Polish)** Keep the list visible during pull-to-refresh (spinner only on first load),
   not flipping `state` to `.loading` full-screen.
4. Capture a real ESPN response → `NWSLAppTests/Fixtures/scoreboard.json` + a decode-only
   test for `Scoreboard`/Event helpers (date parsing, `dayKey` TZ).
6. **Match-detail V2 follow-ups (remaining):** `/headshots` route + NWSL-GUID↔ESPN-id map →
   headshots on pitch dots/`PlayerCard`; future-preview season averages; dynamic
   `currentSeasonYear`.
9. **(Fragility)** `MatchStore.matches(for:)` joins club↔game by `abbreviation` (no id
   on ESPN competitors); a rename silently empties a schedule. Fix: a normalized id map.
18. **Weather API + kickoff-temp header slot** — its own push (API key in Secrets,
    venue→coords, fetch-at-kickoff). The header info row already renders conditionally, so
    re-adding the 🌡 slot is a one-line change.

**Feature follow-ups (from shipped redesigns)**
- **Team-detail Stats + PlayerDetailView** — on **real** ESPN stats (#8). Remaining: a
  most-recent-formation pitch.
- **(Data/Verify) Team social links** — ⚠️`TeamSocialLinksProvider` seed; verify Reddit
  (**KC** `r/KCCurrent`, **CHI** `r/redstars` vs `r/ChicagoStars`; **BOS/DEN/LOU** none).
- **Follow-confirmation sheet** — first-time "what following buys you" on the header star.
- **Home Module 1** — LIVE. Remaining: a "See all" destination + refetch-on-follows-change.
- **Home Module 2 spotlight** — LIVE (B2/0.3.8). Remaining: no-repeat-per-season,
  player-video match, opt-in weekly notif, badge, refetch-on-follows-change.
- **Home Module 3 games** — the live swap is the **Fan Zone (0.3.9)** work in Category 1.

**Longer-term (vision — see `Reference/Sessions/`)**
11. **Feed backend** — Bluesky + Haiku filter LIVE. Remaining: user-added sources; richer
    filtering. (Reddit/A3 deferred.)
12. **Push notifications.** Tier 1 (LOCAL) shipped 0.3.2. Tier 2 (SERVER push)
    code-complete through Stage C (≈0.4.x; PR #32) — app side + Worker (private sibling
    `~/Projects/nwslapp-match-watcher`: 1-min cron, KV state-diff via `/scoreboard`, APNs
    `.p8` JWT; detects kickoff · goal · halftime · full-time). Infra provisioned + APNs
    verified 2026-06-10 (`push_infra_provisioned` memory). **Remaining:** flip `APNS_HOST`
    sandbox→production at TestFlight; on-device E2E (waits on July break). **Stage D (next):
    subs + lineup-posted** (needs per-match `/summary`). (See `…/2026-06-04_server-pulls-and-push.md`.)
13. **Competition-aware schedule.** Groundwork: 3 Schedule filters, `MatchCard`'s dormant
    `CompetitionBadge`, `FollowedCompetition` + follow set. Remaining: a competition field
    on `Event` + a follow-edit surface.
14. **Engagement / Home hub** — spotlights, community links, prediction games. Home modules
    first; a tab only if earned.
